BI-RADS ULTRASOUND LEXICON & ASSESSMENT CATEGORIES

1. SHAPE (Şekil)
- Oval: Elliptical shape, may have 2 or 3 undulations (gentle lobulations). Suggests benign.
- Round: Spherical, ball-shaped.
- Irregular: Shape that is neither round nor oval. Suggests malignancy.

2. MARGIN (Kenar)
- Circumscribed: Well-defined, sharp borders. Suggests benign.
- Indistinct: No clear boundary between mass and surrounding tissue.
- Spiculated: Lines radiating from the mass. Highly suggestive of malignancy.

3. ECHO PATTERN (Eko Yapısı)
- Anechoic: No internal echoes (black). Typical for simple cysts.
- Hypoechoic: Darker than fat. Most solid masses are hypoechoic.
- Isoechoic: Same echogenicity as fat.

4. BI-RADS CATEGORIES & MANAGEMENT
- Category 0: Incomplete. Need additional imaging.
- Category 1: Negative. Routine screening.
- Category 2: Benign. Routine screening. (e.g., Simple cyst).
- Category 3: Probably Benign. Short-interval follow-up (6 months) suggested. Malignancy risk < 2%.
- Category 4: Suspicious. Biopsy should be considered. Risk 2-95%.
- Category 5: Highly Suggestive of Malignancy. Biopsy required. Risk > 95%.
- Category 6: Known Biopsy-Proven Malignancy. Surgical excision required.
